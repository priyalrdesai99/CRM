# CRM
 Customer Relationship Management
It’s a platform that connects your different departments, from marketing to sales to customer service, and organizes their notes, activities, and metrics into one cohesive system. Every user has easy, direct access to the real-time client data they need. This allows for unparalleled coordination across teams and departments and makes it possible for businesses to provide their customers with something extraordinary: personalized, one-to-one customer journeys. Compare that to the limited functionality of old analog and legacy systems, and you have something with the ability to revolutionize the way you connect with customers. You can’t define CRM software without taking into consideration SaaS and cloud computing, both of which work together to allow CRM platforms to be available wherever a user has the internet. Because of these technologies, cloud-based CRM software can grow and scale with your business, so every company, no matter the size, can benefit from a CRM-software-based system.
